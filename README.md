# COMP1004 Coursework (TimeTrackr)
 
This is the GitHub repo for COMP1004 coursework.
## Project Vision
For users to be able to readily identify “time sinks” - leisure activities that eat into time that should be spent on other, more productive, activities. The program allows the user to see “at a glance” where their time has been spent. TimeTrackr integrates hardware in the form of Hue Lights for this purpose.

## Instructions

To begin, select the desired user from the dropdown list. The screen will populate with information.

The layout changes depending on screen size to improve user experience. On smaller screens (i.e. mobile phones and tablets), the order of components changes to make it easier to navigate.

To add new data to the system, you can either time your activity or manually input time.

### Timing activities

TimeTrackr has a custom-coded timer to allow hands-free monitoring. Simply click to start the timer and walk away to your activity. Just don't forget to stop it! Once you've stopped it, make sure you've selected both your user and an activity to log, and press submit. Note: the timer rounds your logged time to the closest minute. 

There is no limit to how long you can leave your timer running, so be careful! If you make a mistake and don't want to log the time recorded, just press reset. Bear in mind, however, that this cannot be undone.

### Manually inputting time

Much like the automatic timer, you can manually input times of up to three hours, in increments of five minutes. Select your time, user and activity and press submit.
